            <p><h2>The Power of Now</h2>
                by <span class="author">Eckhart Tolle</span>

            <h4>Book Description</h4>
            <p>
                To make the journey into the Now we will need to leave our analytical mind and its false created self, 
                the ego, behind. From the very first page of Eckhart Tolle's extraordinary book, we move rapidly into 
                a significantly higher altitude where we breathe a lighter air. <br>
                We become connected to the indestructible essence of our Being, “The eternal, ever present One Life beyond 
                the myriad forms of life that are subject to birth and death.” Although the journey is challenging, 
                Eckhart Tolle uses simple language and an easy question and answer format to guide us. A word of mouth phenomenon since its first publication, 
                The Power of Now is one of those rare books with the power to create an experience in readers, one that can radically change their lives for the better.
