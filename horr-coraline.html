            <p><h2>Coraline</h2>
                by <span class="author">Neil Gaiman, Dave McKean</span>
            </p>
            <h4>Book Description</h4>
            <p>
                When Coraline steps through a door to find another house strangely 
                similar to her own (only better), things seem marvelous.
                But there's another mother there, and another father, and they want 
                her to stay and be their little girl. They want to change her and never let her go. <br>
                Coraline will have to fight with all her wit and courage if she is to save herself and return to her ordinary life.
                Neil Gaiman's Coraline is a can't-miss classic that enthralls readers age 8 to 12 but also adults who enjoy a perfect smart spooky read.
